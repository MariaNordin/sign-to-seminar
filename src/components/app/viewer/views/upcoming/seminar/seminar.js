            <h1>British Humour</h1>

            <p>A strong theme of sarcasm and self-deprecation, often with deadpan delivery, runs bla bla bla.
            runs throughout British humour. Humour maay be used to bury eemotions in a way that seems insensitive 
            to other cultures. Jokes are told about everything and almost no subject.
